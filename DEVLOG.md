External infrastructure provisioned: Supabase project (ExamsIndia),
Cloudflare D1 database and R2 bucket, GitHub repository and CI secrets.
Schema deployed to live D1 and verified. Deploy pipeline (GitHub Actions

Worker.

First application code: Worker auth/routing skeleton. JWKS-based
Supabase JWT verification (ES256, native Web Crypto, no dependencies),
CORS allowlist enforcement, exam_code derived from Origin, /whoami test
route. Verified negative paths via curl (bad origin, missing/invalid
token); valid-token path deferred until a real signed-up test account
exists.
